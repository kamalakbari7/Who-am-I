  I am a Geomatics PhD Candidate (Spatial Information Science) in the Infrastructure Department at Melbourne University, and working on Causal Inference in the spatial and geographical processes. I studied Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing for my master degree. I have had experiences in different environmental, health, human behaviour, and data management projects. In addition, I have more than four years of teaching experience. Also, I was the vice president of the GIES committee in the Infrastructure Department between 2020-21, and we held a fantastic conference. 
  I have knowledge about Spatial Statistics, Spatial Analysis, Causal Inference, Agent-based Modelling, Python and R programming. I am familiar with different tools and software related to GIS and RS, such as ArcGIS, QGIS, FME, ENVI, and ERDAS. Moreover, I founded and managed a knowledge-based company to provide location-based services, generate economic growth and employment for society. 
  My interested fields cover various topics, including GIS, Causal Inference, Mobility Analysis, GeoMarketing, Pedestrian Modelling, Spatial Data Mining, and Spatial Database Designing.
  I am confident that my combination of skills and experiences will help me to have a good collaboration with the academic and industrial world.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
